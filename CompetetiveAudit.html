Engagement: How
engaging is the app? Is it 
visually appealing? Does
it have sound and
animation to capture the
user's attention? Does it
have a good balance of
challenge and reward?
</td>
        <td class="good">Khan Acadamy is a very engaging
                        website dessigned to teach users how to code in HTML and Javascript. This is accomplished by structuring information distribution like a course combining videos structured like lectures with assesments to ensure the user was paying attention. The website uses cute characters and animations to make the website more lively. 9/10 </td>
        <td class="bad">W3School doesn't track user's progress whatsoever. It's most effectively used as a dictionary for code. While it gives users the ability to alter code and see hoe it changes webpages, there is no error checking, correcting or reward for your actions. 2/10</td>
        <td class="good">DataCamp is very similar to Khan acadamy but uses more animations as opposed to the png character's Khan Acadamy uses. Completing courses rewards the user with "XP" and to encourage the user to keep learning, a streak system is added giving users a sense of oblication to return to the app. The user also cannot access later lessons until the previous ones are completed, further rewarding learning. 10/10 </td>

        <td>Progress tracking: How
well does the app track
the user's progress? Does
it provide feedback and
recommendations to help
users improve their
performance? Does it use
data to personalize the
learning experience?</td>
        <td class="good">Khan Acadamy awards the user with expierience points which unlock different avatars upon reaching certain milestones. There is also an element of gamification in the form of a streak system giving users a sense of obligation to get the number as high as possible. If the section has already been complete before, it will not give expierience points. 10/10</td>
        <td class="bad">W3School makes no attempt to track the players progress. Any input the user makes can be undone with one button for the most part. There is no reward for learning aside from what's used in other software. 0/10</td>
        <td class="mid">DataCamp awards expierience points to users who complete lessons but is only used to put the user higher on the leader board and isn't used to unlock new things or avatars similar to Khan acadamy. 6/10</td>

    <tr>
        <td>
User experience: How
user-friendly is the app?
Is it easy to navigate and
use? Does it have clear
instructions and
prompts? Does it have a
well-designed interface?
        </td>
        <td class="mid">Khan Acadamy allows users to edit code used in a video but forces the video to be stopped as control is taken away from the user while it's playing. This ensures that the user is paying attention but at the detrement of hands on learners. The assessment buttons also blend in with the rest of the page making them more difficult to notice causing users to get things wrong that they shouldn't have. 6/10</td>
        <td class="good">W3School keeps a consistent structure throughout it's pages. Each page begins with how the code is used and it what context it would be used in. After that the syntax is provided with a try it yourself button which takes the player to a page where the code is run. The user can then edit this code and see the effects it has on the website. If the user wants to go back/ undo a mistake they can use the button provided. 10/10</td>
        <td class="bad">DataCamp uses a subscription system but provides some courses for free. To encourage users to purchase the subscription, they are bombarded with ads and popups that cannot be removed that hinder vision. It isn't made very clear what courses require a subscription so users may be demoralised when seeing a course they are interested in locked behind a pay-wall. 3/10</td>
