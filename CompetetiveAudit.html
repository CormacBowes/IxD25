        <td class="good">Khan Acadamy is a very engaging
                        website dessigned to teach users how to code in HTML and Javascript. This is accomplished by structuring information distribution like a course combining videos structured like lectures with assesments to ensure the user was paying attention. The website uses cute characters and animations to make the website more lively. 9/10 </td>
        <td class="bad">W3School doesn't track user's progress whatsoever. It's most effectively used as a dictionary for code. While it gives users the ability to alter code and see hoe it changes webpages, there is no error checking, correcting or reward for your actions. 2/10</td>
        <td class="good">DataCamp is very similar to Khan acadamy but uses more animations as opposed to the png character's Khan Acadamy uses. Completing courses rewards the user with "XP" and to encourage the user to keep learning, a streak system is added giving users a sense of oblication to return to the app. The user also cannot access later lessons until the previous ones are completed, further rewarding learning. 10/10 </td>
